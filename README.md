# IIITB-Hogwarts
This is going to be fun project for our college students. Thinking of bringing Harry Potter style group division into college. This is going to be a mobile application and the platform/frameworks are subject to discussion. 

# Note for interested fellow contributors
-> This is just a thought and needs a lot of improvements, suggestions that are heartily invited.
-> Pull requests would be merged in, according to mutual calls of all the group members.
-> Code written should be well organized with meaningful variable names and comments, so that it can sync in well with all fellow team mates.
-> Complete blue print would be posted soon, is still under discussion.

# Expectations
I expect to create a project that can be put up in front of our college students as a beautiful piece of effort, dedication and learning. And I hope we all learn about making real projects in teams and using git, an important skill. This is going to be a non-profit initiative, although expenses need to be met for which certain ways can be thought of later.
